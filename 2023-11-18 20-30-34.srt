1
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,945
So... what you're trying to say is that you fell here

 2
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,653
From another world?

3
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:32,500
But when you wanted to leave

4
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,146
And go on yo the next world

5
00:00:36,276 --> 00:00:37,500
Your path was blocked

6
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:39,648
By some unknown god?

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,800
Outlanders, your jorney ends here

8
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,500
Who're you!?

9
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,400
The sustainer of heavenly principles

10
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,000
The arrogation of mankind ends now

11
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:42,520
Lumine!

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,500
Whait, don't go!

13
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,080
Give my sister back!

14
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:33,100
And just like that, the god took away my sister.
Some kind of seal was cast upon me, and I lost my power.
So while we used to travel from world to world, we are now trapped here.

15
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,100
How many years ago was it? I don't know...

16
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,800
But I intended to find out.

17
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,250
When I woke, I was all alone - until I met you two months ago...

18
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,000
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Yeah, Paimon really owes you for that. Otherwise Paimon likely would have drowned...</i>

19

<b>Paimon:</b> <i>So, Paimon will do her best to be a great guide!</i>

20
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,010
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>We should head off. Let's get going!</i>

21
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,300
1.Open the world map.
2. Select an unlocked <b>Teleport Waypoint</b> to teleport to that location.

22
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,150
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>The path ends here - guess we'll just have to <b>climb</b></i>


23
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:52,000
<b>Paimon:</b> <i><b>Climbing</b> depletes <b>stamina</b>, and depleted stamina takes time to recover!</i>

24
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,100
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Okay, let's take the route we planned!</i>

25
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,650
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>We're off to... a Statue of The Seven!</i>

26
00:03:59,725 --> 00:04:02,500
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Which of The Seven are you looking for exactly?</i>

27
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,500
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Oh wowwwww!</i>

28
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,120
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>That's a Statue of The Seven!</i>

29
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:37,000
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>There are a few of these statues scattered across the land to show The Seven's protection over the world.</i>

30
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:43,100
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Among the seven gods, this god controls the wind.</i>

31
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:47,500
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Paimon's not sure wheter the god you're looking for is the Anemo God, but...</i>

32
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,100
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Paimon's take you to the Anemo God's place first, and there's a reason why~</i>

33
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,100
Prologue: Act 1
<b>The Otlander Who Caught the Wind</b>

34
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:03,150
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>As we all know, poetry and language flow loike the wind...</i>
(<b>Та трясся!</b> "Як ми всі знаємо" - сценарний прийом багатьма критикується. Типу - коли у тебе сценарна імпотенція, а треба навалити експозиції)

35
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,130
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>There'll definitely be someone there who knows about your sister. At least, that's what Paimon thinks!</i>

36
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:13,130
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Wheter the gods actually answer you is a different story. You never know unless you try.</i>

37
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,400
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>So, let's hop to it!</i>

38
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,290
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>You can <b>swim</b> right over!</i>

39
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,140
<b>Starfell Lake</b>

40
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:21,525
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Ooh! Did you just feel the elements of the world?</i>

41
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,130
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Seems all you had to do was just touch the statue and you got the power of Anemo!</i>

42
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:31,550
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>As much as they may want it, people in this word can never get a hold of powers as easily as you...</i>

43
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,448
<b>Pasichnik:</b> This can't be good...

44
00:06:32,448 --> 00:06:36,459
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>It's a bit rude to say that about power the gods just gave to you!</i>

45
00:06:36,459 --> 00:06:43,300
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>If we keep heading west from here, we'll eventually reach Mondstadt, the City of Freedom.</i>
(Трясся, так і каже - "Мондстад")

46
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:50,500
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Mondstad is the city of wind, because they worship the God of Anemo.</i>

47
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:57,000
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>So perhaps, because you got power from the God of Anemo, you can find some clues there.</i>

48
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:04,000
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>There are also a lots of bards there, so perhaps one of them has heard news of your sister.</i>

49
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,620
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Let's move then!</i>

50
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:11,732
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>The elements in this world responded to your prayers and Paimon thinks that's a lovely sign.</i>

51
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:36,192
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>These are the Anemo powers you got from the Statue of The Seven.</i>

52
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,500
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Aww... Paimon's so jealous! Why doesn't Paimon get cool fighting powers!?</i>

53
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,400
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Wow! What is that!?</i>

54
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,400
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>There's something huge, in the sky!</i>

55
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,015
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>It's headed towards the heart of the forest. We must proceed with caution.</i>

60

<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Oh?</i>

62

<font color="green">Who's there!?</font>

63
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,100
<b>Paimon:</b> <i>That was close! Paimon almost got blown away!</i>

64

<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Luckily Paimon managed to grab hold of your hair! Thanks.</i>

65

<b>Pasichnik: </b>Good thing the dragon didn't notice us.

<b>Paimon:</b> <i>Just what was that? Paimon thought we were gonna get eaten.</i>

67

<b>Paimon:</b> <i>It definitely has something to do with that weirdo who was talking to the dragon...</i>

68
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:38,800
<b>Pasichnik:</b> I can't belive dragons exist in this world...

71
